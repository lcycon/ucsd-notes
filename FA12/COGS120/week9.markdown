NSF Proposal
------------

- Addresses specific challenges
  - Support data-driven interface design for EMR data in clinical settings
  - Provide multimodal interfaces for medial professionals, researchers, and patients
- Goal is to understand how multimodal interfaces could transform healthcare
- Modern IT is imrpoving health-care, but these improvements aren't being seen in practice
- Physician has to use complex menus when entering clinical data
- Patients are not empowered
- This proposal is for data-gathering in clinical setting

Activity Histories
------------------

- Edit Wear & Read Wear
- History-Enriched Digital Objects
- Attribute-Mapped Scrollbars

Capturing Activities with Sensors
---------------------------------

- Intelligent Driver Support System
- 10 Cameras!
- Measures acceleration, pedal position, steering angle, distance to target, speed to target

### Data Collection Revolution ###

- Inexpensive digital recording devices
- Extends data collection into situations that have not typically been accessible
- Allows for observation in greater detail

### A Challenge as well as an Opportunity ###

- More data cannot be the whole answer
- How to capitalize on the opportunity provided by the revolution in activity data capture?
- ChronoViz
  - Multiple sources of video
  - Sensor / Simulation Data
  - Annotations
  - Geographic / Spatial Data
  - Transcript Data
  - Digital Notes

Activity Enriched Computing
---------------------------

### Activity Trails: Episodic Access to Digital Activity ###

- Little of the history of computer-mediated activity is currently made available
- Computing devices only record the *consequences* of our actions
- Mobile devices record even less

**Aiding Context Reinstatement**

- Exploits visual memory
- Does not require much
- Needs to be interpretable by you
