Chapter 14: Controlled and Natural Settings
-------------------------------------------

## 14.2.1 - Labs and Equipment ##

- Distractions are removed
- Superficial environment features may be added to make the task seem more natural
- Video cameras and microphones are used
- There may be an observation space / 1 way glass

## 14.2.3 - iPad usability testing ##

- Thought: People would prefer to browse the web on the iPad, but not on the iPhone
- They performed tests in Fremont and Chicago
- Seven participants: All were experienced iPhone users
  - They were considered to be typical users
  - Age rangee 20s to 60, varied occupation and gender
- Test
  - Participants began by exploring an app that they found interesting on the iPad
  - They were asked to talk about what they were doing
  - Sessions lasted around 90 minutes
  - Then the users were instructed to open specific apps, some of which were optimized for iPad
- Equipment
  - Cameras recorded user actions, iPad display, facial gestures
- Conclusion
  - Users could go on non-iPad optimized sites, but the result was not optimal
  - Links were too small or the font was strange
  - Some usability problems classified according to UX design principles
    - Mental models
    - Navigation
    - Feedback etc.
  - Example: Time Magazine
    - Cover has no hyperlinks
    - Cotents were hard to get to 
  - Buttons and menus were hard to find sometimes
  - People got "lost" in the applications
-Interpreting and Presenting the Data
  - Budia and Nielsen amde a number of reccomendations from the results of their study

## 14.3 - Conducting Experiments ##

- Experiments requre hypothesis
  - Hypothesis involves finding relationships between dependent and independent variables
  - Two-tailed hypothesis: A difference is specified, but not defined
  - One-tailed hypothesis: A difference is specified and defined
- Expiremental design
  - This design should setup proper testing conditions while keeping other variables constant
  - Different-Participant design:
    - Single group of participants allocated randomly
    - Requires a large number of participants to account for individual variation
    - Pre-testing participants may help
  - Same-participant design:
    - Each participant performs in each condition
    - Must counterbalance to reduce ordering effect
  - Matched-Participant design:
    - Participants are placed in pairs according to specified criteria

- t-test
  - Uses a simple equation to test the difference between the means

## 14.4 - Field Studies ##

- Natural settings are "messy"

### In the Wild Study: The UbiFit Garden ###

- Evaluates activity sensing in the wild to understand sedentary patterns
- Three components:
  - Fitness device that monitors different types of activities
  - Journal app for individual activities
  - Glanceable display for mobile phones
  - Infers what the wearer is doing
  - Displays a garden
- Data Collection and Participants
  - Wild field study over 3 weeks, 12 participants
  - How does technology fit into everyday lives?
  - All participants wanted to increase their physical activity
  - Study lasted 21 - 25 days, 3 interviews
- Data Analysis and Presentation
  - Gathered a bunch of qualitative data
