- By recording the screen, could we bring people back into context when returning to work?

### SenseCam ###

- Microsoft's experimental camera
- Commercial version: Vicon Revue
- Regular camera that stores pictures automatically, includes other sensors
  - Has a heat sensor to take pictures when near a warm body
  - Accelerometer: Can take photos based on movement, stabilization
  - Can be replayed like a movie
  - Steve Hodges, initial sensecam creator
    - Thought of SenseCom as a "black box"
    - Compact, low-energy were crucial factors
    - Patient with nondegenerative memory loss could remember things if she viewed the 
      SenseCam images two days afterwards
    - Patients with Alzheimer's also benefitted
- SenseCam viewing provided for better recall than writing

### Collaborative Filtering ###

- Google and Amazon do this all the time

- Restaurant Guide: First Cognitive Sciences Conference @ UCSD
  - No good places to eat near campus
  - Who else likes the same restaurants that I like?
    - What else do they like?
- Bellcore MovieRecommender
  - Participants sent e-mail to videos@bellcore.com
  - System replied with a list of 500 movies to rate
  - After rating, system returns similar users results
  - Performed better than professional critics
- PageRank
- Hollan built an engine that also displayed information about what was on the other end of a 
  link.
  - That wasn't very valuble
  - Users cared more about time indicated by popup delay, rather than image relevancy
