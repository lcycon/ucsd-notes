Chapter 15: Evaluation
----------------------

## 15.2 - Inpections: Heuristic Evaluation and Walkthroughs ##

- If users are not accessible, then experts can provide feedback

## 15.2.1 - Heuristic Evaluation ##

- Developed by Nielsen
- Experts decide whether the interface obeys usability guidelines
- Include UX principals and:
  - Aesthetic and Minimalistic Design
  - Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
  - Help and documentation
- How many evaluators are required?
  - Different evaluators produce different results
  - Nielsen recommends between 3 and 5 evaluators

### Turning Design Guidelines into Heuristics ###

- Translate design guidelines into questions for use in heuristics

### Doing Heuristic Evaluation ###

1. Briefing session: Experts are told what to do, uses a script
2. Evaluation period: Expert spends 1 to 2 hours inspecting the product
  - First pass: Expert gets a feel for the interaction flow and the product scope
  - Second pass: Focus on specific interface elements
3. Debriefing session: Evaluators come together to discuss their findings, prioritize their 
   problems

### 15.2.2 - Walkthroughs ###

- Generally don't involve users
- Cognitive Walkthroughs 
  1. Characteristics of typical users are identified, sample tasks are developed
  2. Designer and evaluators work together to do analysis
  3. Evaluators work throughb action sequences
    - Will the correct action be evident to the user?
    - Will the user notice that the correct action is available?
  4. Record critical information during is compiled
    - Assumptions about what would cause problems and why they are identified
    - Notes about side issues
    - Compiles a summary of results
  5. Design is revised to fix problems presented
- It is important to document the process of a cognitive walkthrough
- Rick Spencer developed a more coarse-grained cognitive walkthough
- Pluralistic Walkthroughs
  - Users, developers, and experts do the walkthrough together

## 15.3 - Analytics ##

- Mountain Wines
  - Spends $10000 / month in advertising
  - Hasn't changed their website because they don't know how their changes would affect it

## 15.4.1 - The GOMS Model ## 

- Goals
- Operations
  - Cognitive processes and physical actions that need to be performed to acheive goals
  - A goal is obtained, while an operation is executed
- Methods
  - Learned procedures for accomplishing goals
  - The exact sequence of steps required
- Selection
  - Used to determine which method to use to complete an operation

## 15.4.2 - The Keystroke Level Model ##

- Timing is defined for specific actions

## 15.4.3 - Benefits and Limitations of GOMS ##

- KLM is useful for calculating the effectiveness of keyboard layouts
- GOMS is often not used for evauation purposes
  - Limited scope: can only do computer based tasks
  - Only predicts expert performance
- Predictive modesl can only make predictions about predictable behavior

## 15.4.4 - Fitt's Law ##

- Predicts the time it takes to read a target using a pointing device
- Useful when deciding where to place buttons
- Bigger target is easier to reach
- Placing buttons at the corner of the screen are the best idea, but designers generally 
  don't do this
