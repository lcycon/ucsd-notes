Chapter 12: Introducing Evaluation
----------------------------------

## 12.3.1 Controlled Settings Involving Users ##

- Controlled settings allow researchers to control more of the action, 
  without external influences or distractions.
- This is often used to evaluate PC software

### Usability Testing ###

- UT involves collecting data from many different sources in a controlled
  setting
- UT is generally done in labs but now it is often done remotely or in 
  natural settings
- The primary goal is to determine whether the interface is suitable for use 
  with the user population for which it was designed.
- This is a staple of HCI


## 12.3.2 Natural Settings Involving Users ##

- Field studies evaluate people in their natural settings
  - Help identify opportunities for new tech
  - Establish requirements for new design
  - Faciiate introduction or use of new/existing technology
- Commonly use observation, interviews, and logging

## 12.3.3 Any Settings Not Invlolving Users ##

- Inspection is one example
- Heuristics / walkthroughs
- *Cognitive Walkthrough*: Simulates a user's problem solviing problem 
  through each step of a dialogue. Used to evaluate ease of learning
- *Analytics*: Data logging

## 12.3.5 Opportunistic Evaluations ##

- Generally done early in the design process to provide designers with quick 
  feedback.
- Informal

## 12.4.1 Case Study 1: Computer Game ##

- Measured subjective ratings of stimulation and physiological indicators for
  10 subjects playing a hockey game

## 12.4.2 Case Study 2: In the Wild Study of Skiers ##

- Skiers were given helmet with accelerometer and mini-camera
- This device transmitted data to their smartphone, which they could access in
  real-time
- The skiers were found to view their information after their riding, not on 
  the slopes as the researchers had predicted.
