# Investigating the Organization of Meaning #

- Features of Meaning
  - Pairs of items that share distinctive features will be judged to be more similar than
    pairs of items that do not share features
- Similarity Judgements
  - Pairs of items that are judged to be similar share distinctive features

Eliciting Similarity Judgements
-------------------------------

- Free Association
- Pile Sorting
- Triads
- Latent semantic indexing
  - If you take a coherent text, you get similarity with nearby words

- Organizing Opportunities for Co-Occurance

Holland And Skinner Methods
---------------------------

- Interviews to elicit gender types and descriptions of the types
- Sort cards bearing type names into piles
  - Piles -> Similarity Metrics -> Multidimensional Scaling
  - Identify themes or dimensions
- Participant observation and more interviews
  - Talking diary
  - Describe a relationship
- What do informants assume about ordinary relationships between males and females?
- Which are taken for granted worlds in which males and females interact?

Synecdoche: A part stands for the whole

- What did they get from the interview data?
  - The scaling they did didn't tell them anything about how women think about men / 
    men think about women

The Women's Model of Romantic Relationship
------------------------------------------

- Man shows affection and attention to woman's needs
- Man is sensitive to woman's response
- Man is attractive
- Woman returns affection and permits intimacy to develop
- "Treat me right and we'll see"

- Most of the labels in Holland and Skinner's data describe violations in this model

The Men's Model (As seen by women)
----------------------------------

- My woman is hot!
- Let's move this intimacy thing along
- Give me some space

Quinn's List of Classes of Metaphors for Marriage
-------------------------------------------------

- Lastingness
- Sharedness
- Mutual Benefit
- Compatibility
- Difficulty
- Effort
- Success / Failure
- Risk

Quinn's Causal Model
--------------------

- A marriage is *successful* if it lasts
- In order to last, a marriage must be *beneficial to both partners*
- To be beneficial, *difficulties* must be overcome with *effort*


*To find cultural models, answer these questions:*

- What is assummed, taken for granted?
- What are the parst of the world and what are the relations among the parts of that world?

(Don't ask these exactly, duh)

- TODO: Create an opportunity for your subject to talk about something that you're interested
  in
  - They will use the assummed world in order to organize their discourse

# Cultural Models in Media #

Our Procedure
-------------

1. Use knowledge of culture to read the "taken for granted" assumptions that organize the 
   representation (Identify the cultural model)
2. Make these cultural models explicit 
3. Find other evidence on the location of the cultural model in the congitive ecosystem

Where can cultural models be found?

- Song Lyrics
- Advertising
- Sales Pitch
- Jokes
- "Noxious Substance Model"

Con: Use cultural models against someone

# American Folk Model of Mind #

A Cultural Model is..
---------------------

- A cognitive schema that is intersubjectively shared by a social group
- Typically consists of a small number of conceptual objects and their relation to each other

### Buying Schema ###

- Parts
  - Buyer, sellar, merchandise, price, sla,e money
- Relations
  - Assummed sequence of events:
    1. Seller makes intention to sell
    2. Buyer makes offer
    3. Buyer gives money to seller
    4. Seller gives merchandise to seller

Schemas have hierarchical organizations.

### Intersubjective Sharing ###

- Everybody knows the schema
- Everybody knows that everybody knows that everyone understands

### Using Schemas to Understand the World ###

- Sense of reality is grounded in cultural schemas
- When events are interpreted using cultural models, the interpretations are treated as if they 
  are obvious facts about the world
- Therefore, you don't need to be explicit about everything
  - Partial instantiation triggers "filling in"
