# The Dialectic of Arithmetic in Grocery Shopping #

Author's claim: Arithmetic activity is strongly shaped by the broader scope of 
                activity and the setting where it occurs, as well as past 
                experiences and beliefs

Adult Math Skills Project was designed to investigate arithmetic decision-making 
processes during grocery shopping.

Extensive interviewing with 25 adult shoppers in OC. Varied income and education,
all were educated in public schools.

Shoppers wore a tape recorder and were asked to think aloud

Barker: An environment can be a "behavior setting" if little of the behavior found
        in that setting could be extended to another setting.

Settings: Are they objective, independent of observers and participants, or are they 
          the constructions of participants?

The supermarket as arena is a product of patterns of capital formation and political
economy.

The Construct of Activity
-------------------------

Leontiev defines 3 levels of activity:
  
  1. Energizing force (hunger)
  2. Action defined by it's goal
  3. Operations (subgoals)

Zinchenko's research: Material this is the immediate goal of an action is remembered
                      better than when it is related to operations

Therefore, to comprehend the nature of arithmetic activity, one must understand how
it is contextualized.

The supermarket can be an arena: a non-negotiable realization of a political economy, 
as well as a personalized activity setting.
