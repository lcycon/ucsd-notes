The Natural History of an Interview
-----------------------------------

- Object of analysis: Film of a married couple during a psychiatric interview
- Analyses: Non-verbal behavior, cultural, psychiatric
- Attempted to find patterns in each type of behavior and the relations amongst them
- Created a 1500 page manuscript that was never published

Audio Recordings and Discourse Analysis
---------------------------------------

- Malinowski recorded Trobriand Islands "Magic Texts" by writing them down in a textbook
  because it was the only way to record the exact words
- Philosopher Dorothy Lee studied the texts and concluded that Trobrianders don't understand
  causality
- However, magic isn't the same as everyday discourse

Different Inferences
--------------------

- What words were uttered in natural discourse?
- Word order and logical relations could be reconstructed from the discourse
- Tempo and Rythm
- Stress Contours
- Rhetorical Devices (Repitition, Alliteration, Enumeration)

Audio Recording Makes Possible
------------------------------

- Phonology
- Pragmatics
- Discourse Analysis
