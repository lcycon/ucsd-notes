What we experience: what do we experience it as?

What is available to introspection?
-------------------------------------

- It's not hard to notice actions
- Everything experienced is experienced as "something"
  - Experience is always constructed (a narrative truth)

- Sense-making practices allow us to have beliefs, feelings, desire, and intention

Perhaps behavior causes consciousness

Folk model of mind may not be a useful scientific concept

Vocab Building
--------------

- Agonistic: Conflict
- Hagiography: Writing to elevate someone to sainthood

Some Background Ideas
---------------------

- Science creates new knowledge
- Knowing is a form of cognition
- Science is a form of cognition
- Science changed dramatically in a 400 year period 1600 - 2000
- This creates a divide between the haves and the have-nots

What Creates the Great Divide?
------------------------------

- The notion of a "Great Divide" is just a socially constructed reality
- Created by cultural and discursive practices

### Poor Explanations ###

- Economic forces
- Evolution of human brains
- A lucky run of scientific geniuses
- Above explanations assumme commensurability of cause and effect
  - But our systems are radically non-linear

Perhaps it's just the production and the circulation of inscriptions?
