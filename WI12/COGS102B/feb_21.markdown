Background
----------

- Establish the context of the activity
- Tell the reader enough about the setting for them to understand the analysis

### Boeing 727 ###

- Old plane
- Cockpit
  - Has places for 3 crew members: Captain, First Officer, Flight Engineer
  - Flight Engineer sits behind the First Officer
- All modern cockpits only fit 2 crew members, the flight engineer's job has been replaced 
  by computers
  - Early cockpits had room for five members

- Pronouns:
  - *We* have a leak. *I* turned off the pumps
- Time deixis: Reporting on events in the past tense
  - We *have* a leak. I turn*ed* off the pumps


Analysis
--------

- What information is encoded by talk/gesture/world?
  - Important: Look at word choices
- How do they inform each other
- Gesture adds meaning to a static diagram

Sequence Mismatch
-----------------

- Gesture and speech were *supposed* to be temporally coordinated
- Gesture can be expressive action (not pragmatic or epistemic)

  a gesture in meaning -- Kendon 2004
