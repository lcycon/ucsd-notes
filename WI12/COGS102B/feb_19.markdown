# February 19th Lecture #

Before the advent of the printing press, books were very expensive and it was 
hard to transfer ideas.

Latour Asks: Why do the first books contain medieval figures rather than
realistic figures?

"The displacement of many immutable mobiles comes first; the old texts are 
spread everywhere and can be gathered more cheaply in one place. But then the
contradictions among them become visible in the most literal sense" - Latour

"A new interest in 'Truth' does not come from a new vision, but from the same 
old vision applying itself to new visible objects taht mobilize space and time
differently"

"The printing press does not add anything to the mind, to the scientific method,
to the brain. It simply conserves and spreads everything no matter how wrong, strange,
or wild"

Latour: The Truth (truth-protection) is a modern way of thinking, which came about
from our practices of moving around inscriptions

Non-literate culture: You never need to know "exactly" what someone spoke

Latour: "*Anything* that will accelerate the mobility of the traces that a location
may obtain about another place, or *anything* that will allow these traces to
move without transformation from one place to another will be favored"

Bohr's Model of the Atom
------------------------

- A metaphor for atoms using solar-system analogy
- It allows us to think about how atom works

Copernican Solar System
-----------------------

- Used Circles: They are a perfect geometric shape
- Revolutionary Idea: The sun is in the center
- Brahe realized that the planets could not have a circular orbit
  - Used a "cascade of inscriptions" to see the contradictions in the data

M31, The Andromeda Galaxy
-------------------------

- A pretty picture of the sky is not useful


Latour: "An average mind or an average man, with the same perceptual abilities,
within normal social condition" will generate totally different output depending
on whether she is following the world or the inscriptions


The Power of Bureaucracy
------------------------

"A man whose eye dominates records through which some sort of connections are established"


# Citizenship in the Digital Age #

# Neuroscience students learning to see visual areas in a functional brain image #

"In science, just as in art and life, only that which is true to culture is true 
 to nature" - Ludwik Fleck, The genesis and development of a scientific fact

Retinotopic Mapping
-------------------

- Retinotopic Map: Point-for-Point copy of the topography of the retina
- Brain researchers perform acts of scientific imagination in coordination with 
  observable representations
- The thinking is in the acting

# Mice Fall Short as Test Subjects for Human's Deadly Ill's #

- This paper was not allowed to be published
- Reviewers said, "It has to be wrong"
  - You can only get your paper published in *Science* if it is true to the culture 
    of science
  - This finding did not fit with the way people thought about the world

Fleck: "All theories contain some element of wishful thinking"

and    "The meaning and truth value of a finding is a function of the community"
