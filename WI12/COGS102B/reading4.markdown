Some definitions
----------------

**Ontogeny**: The study of an organism's lifespan

**Phylogeny**: The study of evolutionary relationships amongst groups of organisms

**Ethogram**: A catelogue of all behaviors or actions exhibited by an animal

**Repertoire**: The whole body of items that are regurarly performed

Motivation
----------

- We want to understand the cognitive lives of other species
- Johnson claims that we can do this because cognition is largely visible
- We want to *see cognition in everyday activity*

Questions
---------

- Why does Johnson put the emphasis on the process rather than the products of cognition?
- Why does Johnson put the emphasis on interacts rather than on types of acts?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of qualitative studies?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of quantitative studies?
- What is micro-ethology?

"Observing Cognitive Complexity in Primates and Cetaceans" - Christine Johnson

"'Cognition' is taken as embodied, largely visible and distributed across physical and 
 social environments"

This paper examines studies on cog.complexity evident by the animals behavior

### Hierarchical Organization ###

Can be seen in a subroutine that fails to disrupt the larger routine. For example, embedding
one social interaction within the frame of another (social tool use). Can be seen in using 
subroutines as a tactical response.

Complexity can be seen in long-term patterning regard histories and the ecological / social
"market". 


Much more work has been done on primates than on cetaceans, but they appear to share similar
attributes. They have large brains, are good problem solvers, and have complex societies in the
wild.

Captive dolphins are housed communally, so they provide many examples of social interaction.

Observational methods are very compatible with embodied models of cognition. Embodied models 
show congition arising through engaagement with the world, the motivate ontological analysis.
One starts by examining the interface between the species and the world

  - What can be discriminated
  - What is salient
  - What arouses
  - What are the possible motor reactions

However cognition is the _adaptiveness of behavior_. This is largely visible. One can see how 
behaviors are modifed with fluctation of setting. By studying the process of learning, one
can see regularities and requirements of cognition.

Some models of embodied cognition define complexity in terms of implied mental representations.
However this paper is only focused on studying what is visible.

**Micro-Ethology**: The quantitative analysis of moment-by-moment interactions in a 
naturalistic setting

Qualitative Analysis
--------------------

Qualitative accounts tend to involved detailed narrative descriptions of a small number of 
particular events. These events could be either typical or rare. These accounts generally 
situate the events in a social / historical context.

Compared to quantitave methods, qualitative descriptions are potentially less reliable or
generalizable. Qualitative methods could be warped due to the reporter ("expert vision")

Quantitative Analysis
---------------------

Include "quasi-experiments" and ecological approaches. Quasi-experimental studies modify the
environment in some way but do not constrain the the range of responses that the animal can
produce. Quantitave studies require well-sepcified scoring criteria and a high sampling rate

Some quantitative studies try to maximize the number of subjects sampled in order to produce
statistically significant results. Generally these subjects are focused on one aspect of 
behavior.

Because micro-analysis needed to assess cognition requires micro-analysis, it is often 
performed on a low sample size due to effort

Micro-Ethology
--------------

Both qualitative and quantitative observations emply micro-ethology. Micro-Ethology is the 
frame-by-frame analysis of interaction. This is becoming more popular as technology improves

Traditional ethology documents macro-level behavioral categories, and often involves pooling 
data across subjects. This can provide importat background-information, but micro-ethology
permits us to examine the "contents" of the distributed mind

Depending on the questions being addressed, micro-analytic studies vary in the level of detail
that they score. 

Studying cognition as adaptive engagemnts demands a distributed unit of analysis. Types
of interactions matter, not types of acts. The surrounding environment changes the analysis.

Studying interaction raises issues of "affordances". For example, proximity affords some types
of interaction. Tracking affordances over time leads to "co-regulation". Some (inter)actions
afford other previously unavailable actions. Social co-regulation is important.
