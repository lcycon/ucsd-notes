# Original Carving of the Social World #

- Anthropology 
  - Cognitive Anthropology
  - Ethnography of Speaking
    - Not part of linguistics
    - There is also linguistic anthropology and anthropological linguistics
- Sociology
  - Ethnomethodology
    - How people get stuff done in social situations
- Psychology
  - Volkerpsychologie
    - "Folk" psychology, outside the lab

- Cognitive Ethnography is in the center

# What is Ethnography #

- Ethno = a people / social group
- Graphy = documentation

Documentation of the lifeworld of a people

Ethnography is:
  - A methodology (set of activities)
  - A stance towards human existence
  - A set of theoretical assumptions
    - Human activity has meaning
    - It is culturally organized
  - Participant observation is a key method in ethnographic methodology
    - You move into a community, spend at least a year
    - Endeavor to engage in community
    - The goal is *not* to be become a native, but rather to stand in two worlds

Bronislaw Malinowski, the father of modern ethnographic methods
  - Was stuck in New Guinea from 1914 to 1918.
  - Went to the Trobriand islands
  - Malinowski invents participant observation, and wrote many ethnographies

The job of an ethnographer is to document a particular aspect of a lifeworld

- What are the meanings created and communicated?

- Margeret Mead: "No two cultures are more than a generation apart"

Cognitive Ethnograhy Method
---------------------------

- Careful examination of the details of small events
- Grounded in and informed by rich ethnographic knowledge

Cognitive Ethnography is not for the faint-hearted

- The outcomes cannot be predicted
- It's hard to even know the interesting questions

Practical Problems Exist: Access, privacy, observer effects, equipment failure

The Key Unlocking to the Cognitive Ecosystem
--------------------------------------------

- What information
- Goes where
- When
- In what form

Land Litigation
---------------

- Public
- Cognitive
- Important

Some other places

- Airline cockpit
- Nuclear power control plant
- Swedish fishing fleet
- Kids at play in east LA
- Family dinner
- Family relaxing
- Navigation bridge of a navy ship

Five Contributions of Cognitive Ethnography
-------------------------------------------

1. Understanding Cognitive Ecology
2. Improved functional spec. of human cognitive system
3. Documenting the distribution of cognitive processes across space, time, and society
4. Informing experimental studies
5. Informing design of human systems

Choosing Landmarks
------------------

- Position Fixing by Visual Bearings

Memories for Landmarks

Visual:
- Retino centric
- Head centric
- Body centric

Gesture allows for representation in the motor system and somatosensory system

The brain is just one subsystem
