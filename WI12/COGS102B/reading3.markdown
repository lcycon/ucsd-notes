# Williams: Cognitive Ethnography #

- Cognitive Ethnography is an event-focused method for invsestigating how cognitive activities
  are accomplished in real-world settings

Cognitive Ethnography
---------------------

- Although rooted in traditional ethnography, cognitive ethnography is different from it in
  a fundamental way.
  - Traditional ethnography is interested in the meanings that members of a cultural group
    create
  - Cognitive ethnography is interested in *how* the members create those meanings
  - Cognitive ethnography looks at process, traditional ethnography describes knowledge

- The contrast between the two forms does not imply that they are divorced
  - Participant observation, interviewing, artifact analysis, etc. are common to both
  - Traditional ethnography informs cognitive ethnography
  - Cog. ethnography extends traditional ethnography

Studying Instruction
--------------------

- Instruction allows us to perpetuate cultural practices and maintain cognitive sophistication
- Instruction can be formal (school) or informal (household)
- Also occurs in structured and unstructured ways, spontaneous or planned

- Time-telling instruction highlights some of the issues in this research
- Data was collected in 1st grade, 2nd grade, and 3rd grade classrooms 

### Deciding what to record ###

- You can't just try to record everything
  - Produces way too much data
  - Turns ethnographic work into documentary work
    - Places more importance on recording everything rather that forming relationships
    - Although you could have multiple researchers
  - Choosing where to place the camera would mean that the data would be of little use for 
    other studies
    - Although there are omnidirectional cameras that could do the job

- The ethnographer decided to place the camera from the student's perspective
  - The shots included background setting as well as the objects that the teacher handled and
    referred to
  - This also protected the students' privacy
  - The camera would be panned if necessary

### Selecting Video for Analysis ###

- 9 minute "quarter-past" lecture is segmented into chunks between 14s and 120s.
- From this data, the ethnographer must select segments for detailed analysis
- The ethnographer decided to use "dividing the clock-face into quarters" and "counting the
  clock face to read the time as '(blank) 15'"

### Re-Representing Video Data ###

- Once the segments were selected, they had to be re-represented to support analysis
  - This generally occurs as transcription
  - Transcribing gestures etc. is often problematic
  - Ethnographer uses a multimodal transcript format, so that talk and action could be
    represented simultaneously
    - Images were shown alongside transcript. However, this left the gestures uncoded
    - The challenges of transcription lead to insights that inform and enrich the analysis
 
### Analyzing Data ###

- The teacher does nearly all of the talking
- She retains control over the activity sequence and the student participation
- Students express agreement/understanding and fill-in-the-blank
- The teacher's discourse consists of a phrase containing a single unit of information, 
  followed by a pause.
  - Although the teacher appears to control the discourse, it is actually constrained by the
    students' ability to comprehend the information
  - The content of the teacher's discourse is shaped by the group's shared history and the 
    teacher's immediate goals

- The ethnographer goes line by line through the transcript to explain how each utterance,
  gesture, and action contributed to the construction of meaning
  - A conceptual framework is necessary to analyze memory construction. The ethnographer chose 
    to use conceptual information theory.
- For example for the "If I take my clock" line, the teacher diagrams mental space inputs, 
  cross-space mappings, and the resulted blended space
  - The diagramming shows how the mental space is anchored by structure in the world
    - i.e Superpose the conceptual circle on it's material counterpart
  - The teacher uses speech and gesture to anchor concepts onto material objects
  - This creates a "blended space" that provides a basis for ways to read time as 
    "quarter-past" and "quarter-till"
- When the teacher outlines the clock face, she moves her hand in the direction of the minute
  hand, forming a "source-path-goal" schema
- Importantly, it would be difficult to conduct analysis without knowing about the children's 
  knowledge

Conclusion
----------

- The outcomes of a study can never be cleanly predicted
- Privacy issues, observer effects, equipment failure are all risks
- Methods need to be changed as new phenomena emerge
- Faith is required: we must hope that interesting phenomena will appear in the data
