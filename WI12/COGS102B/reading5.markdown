Goodwin - Professional Vision
-----------------------------

Goodwin describes 3 key discursive practices:

- Coding
- Highlighting
- Produciton of graphical representations

Goodwin claims that competent use of discursive practices allows professionals to see and 
help others to see objects of interest in their profession

### Vocab ###

**Quixotic**: Exceedingly idealistic; unrealistic and impractical

**Perspicuous**: Clearly expressed and easily understood; lucid

**Reify**: Make something more concrete or real

**Constitutive**: Having the power to establish or give organized existence to something

**Endogenous**: Growing or originating from within (an organism)

**Deictic**: Denoting a word or expression whose meaning is dependent on the context in which
             it is used

### Questions ###

- What methods did Goodwin use to document the behavior of archaeologists and police expert
  witnesses?
- What does Goodwin mean when he says that all vision is perspectival and lodged within 
  endogenous communities of practice?
- Does Goodwin use discursive practices in writing his paper?
- Goodwin claims that categories and features in the world mutually elaborate each other. What
  does this mean? How does it relate to the idea of dialectic between setting and activity as
  discussed by Lave and her colleagues?
- How does studying archaeologists prepare us to understand a contentious jury trial?
- What sort of coding scheme did the defense lawyers provide to the jury for understanding 
  Rodney King's actions?
- Why were there no expert witnesses to testify about the practices of people getting beaten?



# Professional Vision #

**Coding Scheme**: Used to transform the materials being attended to in a specific setting into
                   the objects of knowledge that animate the discourse of a profession

**Highlighting**: Making specific phenomena in a complex perceptual field salient by marking
                  them in some fashion

P.V. also has to do with the production and articulation of material representations

**Professional Vision**: Socially organized ways of seeing and understading events that are 
                         answerable to the distinctive interests of a particular social group


The Rodney King trials became a theatre for professional vision. Lawyers on both sides 
structured the perceptual field on the TV according to their own agendas. To see a
meaningful event is not a transparent psychological process, but it is actualy socially 
situated and involves a great deal of discursive practices. To see a
meaningful event is not a transparent psychological process, but it is actualy socially 
situated and involves a great deal of discursive practices. 

This is true for **ALL** vision. An archaeologist and a farmer see differnt phenomena in the 
same patch of dirt. An event being seen (object of knowledge) emerges through the interplay 
between the domain of scrutiny (dirt patch) and a set of discursive practices that are deployed
through a set of pracitces. Similar to Wittgenstein's "language game"

## Goodwin's Practices for Seeing ##

Graphic representations are annotated and highlighted in order to make salient specific events
within them. This guides the reader to know what is important. 

## Coding Schemes ##

Coding schemes are used to transform the world into categories and events thart are relevant
to work in the profession. Notably, when disparate events are viewed through a single coding 
scheme, equivalent observations become possible.

## Highlighting ##

Because cognitive activity often engages a complex perceptual field, a lot of work has to do
with isolating the figure from the ground. The field can be highlighted to make salient what 
is important

## Graphic Representations as Embodied Practice ##

Graphic representations of many different objects are the center of discourse for professions. 
Scientific talks an papers are not just text, but reflexive commentary on the diagrams, graphs, 
and photographs that constitue the heart of a presentation. External representations complement
spoken language, and can organize events in ways that speech cannot.

Conditional Relevance: A first utterance creates an interpretive environment that is used by
                       participants to analyze whatever occurs after it.
