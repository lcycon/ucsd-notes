Neisser's Definition of Memory
------------------------------

- How people use their own past experiences in meeting the present and the future under
  natural conditions
- That's what the immune system does
- Immunization gives a person an experience that changes the way they meet the present and 
  future under natural conditions

Getting Started with CPR
------------------------

- Calibrated Peer Review system
- Mett the grading criteria on the course webpage

### After Writing Your Text ###

- Setup CPR account
- Take the quiz and tutorial
- Resubmissions are allowed

### Four Parts for the CPR 1 Assignment ###

- Text Entry (30 pts)
- Calibrations (30 pts)
- Text Reviews (30 pts)
- Self-Assessment (10 pts)

*Pay Attention to the Calibration Criteria*

### Text Entry ###

- Pay Attention to the instructions and the calibration questions

### Calibrations ###

- Take notes on the sample text
- Read instructions for assigning a score

### Scoring Instructions ###

- Assign a score from 1 to 10 for each text that you review
- Calibration questions guide attention
- Creative / Insightful texts should be rewarded with higher scores

### Text Reviews ###

- Apply calibration criteria to three peer texts
- Your score will depend on how well the score matches to the other scores
- Make a good-faith effor to assign an appropriate score
- Do not apply innappropriate scores

### Self-Assessment ###

- Assign yourself an appropriate score
- Graded on how similar your score is to others scores


How to test memory
------------------

Presentation -> Recitiation

Attend -> Some Time (seconds, hours, months) -> Elicit behavior

Recall vs. Recognition

Testing Problem Solving
-----------------------

Old Dominant Paradigm: Search

Initial State -> Actions -> Goal State 

Choosing Between Actions = Decision Making

Reasoning
---------

If it's raining then the roof is wet. The roof is wet.

Inference

In order to say that someone is engaged in cognitive activity, we **dont** need to know
what is inside their head.

Memory is a fuzzy category, but there are some exemplary cases.

# The Dialectical Constitution of Arithmetic in Grocery Shopping Activity #

Psychological toll of overchoice

How shall we think of the environment for action?

How can we account for the organization of activity?

Our lives are actually highly structured. It's hard to understand what the structure is.

Ex: Lecture Hall.

Some Predictions from the Armchair
----------------------------------

- Shoppers decide which item to buy by computing the best unit price.
  - People with better math skills are more likely to engage in unit price computations
  - People with better math skills are more likely to do the correct calculations
- The environment presents problems that shoppers must find solutions to.
- Math problems are represented and solved in the shopper's minds

Ways To Look
------------

- What methods did Lave and her colleagues use to investigate arithmetic practices in 
  grocery shopping?

They went into people's homes, and asked them questions about what their shopping practices
are. Also administered arithmetic tests and took note of demographic background. Recorded them
in the stores, followed them around the store.

In order to understand arithmetic practices in the supermarket, it is also necessary to 
understand the "dialectical constituion of grocery shopping activity"


What do people do? How is their behavior organized?

It's important to know where the people are. They behave differently in different "arenas"

Setting
-------

- Setting is the arena a sexperiences by a particular person in activity
- Shaped by the person's activity
- Includes body position, arrangements of objects, patterns of deployment, etc

The lecture hall is a different setting for the lecturer than from the students

Activity and Setting mutually shape each other. They are in a dialectical relationship.

Dialectical Relationship: It's impossible to understand the organization of either elment 
without reference to the history of interaction among the elements.

- Narrative Schema
- Determination of activity and setting

Best-Price computations are a last resort

Important
---------

Arena, Activity, Setting

Gap-Closing Problem Solving

What shoppers say is *data*, not analysis
