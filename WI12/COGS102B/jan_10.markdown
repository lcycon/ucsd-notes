# How People Use The Past #

Neisser's Observation: "If X is an interesting memory phenomena,
                        scientists avoid it like the plague"

Important Idea 1
----------------

- Memory is a holdover from medieval psychology
- How do we seperate different kinds of cases?
- What is the probability that those medieval scholars guessed right?

Neisser: Learning theory was crushed by ethologists.

- There was no one-size fits all learning theory.
- Lab findings are not applicable to actual learning.

Neisser: Maybe the same thing that happened to learning will happen to memory

Important Idea 2
----------------

Ecological Validity and Representativeness
  - This is a way to look at what gets done in Psych Experiments
  - Psych Experiments present esoteric tasks and puzzles
    - Puzzles are resistant to repeat task exposure simplification

Neisser's definition:
  - How people use their own past experience in meeting the present and future
    under natural conditions

Neisser: We don't have enough information about medium-term and long-term
         memory. We only have good neuropsychological data about very
         short term memory.

We use the past to construct our selves.

Amnesia would be hazardous to your sense of identity.

Involuntary, Recovered, Constructed memories

Official Remembering
--------------------

- Loftus's eyewitness testimony
  - How fast were the cars going?
  - What the witnesses remembered was based on how they were asked the question.
- Flashbulb memory
  - 9/11

Ecological View
---------------

- Remembering as a skill
- Cultural practices as cognitive enzymes

Neisser: It's not going to be easy

# Project 1 #

Cognitive Diary and Everyday Task

- What is the density of the cognitive activity

Look for ecological assemblies

- An ecological assembly is a configuration of resources that accomplishes 
  a cognitive task
- You should be able to describe the external resources that are part of the 
  cognitive assembly

Avoid mind-reading, only focus on what is observable

Keep the description seperate from the analysis

What is cognitive about this activity?

Look for prior shortcuts.

DONT do mindreading in analysis

You can talk about noticing etc., don't get very deep
