## Two Perspectives on Human Cognition ##

- Psychology Lab
- "Cognito-Scope"

## Cognitive Ethnography ##

- What it is
- How to do it?

# Two Perspectives on Human Cognition #

- Our cognition is based on 70k daily cognitive events
- Basically no observations on everyday cognition

## Marked vs. Unmarked categories ##

- Cognition[unmarked] breaks down into cognition[marked] + situated cognition[marked]

## Lab Cognition vs Everyday Cognition (seen from the lab) ##

- Lab cognition is clean, organized
- Everyday cognition is uncontrolled
  - We need control to do inference
- Lab cognition studies general principals
- Lab cognition is "pure", everyday is applied

# A view through the cognito-scope #

- Around 1000 cognitive events per day per person
- 7e12 cognitive events daily worldwide
- Lab congition is not outside everyday cognition

- Some questions cannot be answered in a lab setting, vice-versa
- Lab tests generally discourage meta-cognition

In the real world, we often move our goals closer, while this is not allowed in the lab.

- According to the cognito-scope view, lab cognition is actually specialized, one-time

- Repeated performances are very powerful. They transform the problem from calculation to 
  memorization.
  
Cognitive Ethnography has no experiments.

# Cognitive Ethnography #

- We can't use brain imaging to study cognition, but we can make inferences

## What is Ethnography ##

- A method
  - Systematic study of the lifeworld of a community
  - How members live, communicate, interact
  - The material and ideational aspects of life
- A product
 - The documentation of a lifeworld


Cognitive Ethographers do this:

1. Make accurate records of specific instances of real-world behavior
2. Analysis of cognitive aspects of those instances
3. Use ethnography as a source of knowledge about what is being done
  - Resources and conventions

Natives know what things mean, but ethnographers know why things mean what they mean

## Big Problem ##

- Our minds are programmed to NOT pay attention to many things
- Most of the interesting details in the world go unnoticed 

### Manifestations of this problem ###

- We considder our daily lives so routine that we don't notice the details
- We fill in gaps in visual scenes, so we don't see the gaps
- We ignore the background to see the figure

Why do we attend to certain things and not to others?

- We don't hear disfluencies in speech 
- We're bad at remembering
- We understand the world through cultural models
  - This makes some thoughts very hard to think
  - We're not always aware of these cultural models
    - Pointing at the sun thought experiment
- We process multiple sources of information, but we don't know about them

- The "seeing, but not seeing" problem

## Tuning the Cognito Scope ##

- Slow down, be honest
- Keep a clear distinction between data and analysis
