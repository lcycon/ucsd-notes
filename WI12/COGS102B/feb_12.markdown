Are beliefs, desires, and intentions any more real than Santa Claus?

# The Bottleneck of Experience #

- We only attend to a certain bit of what is available to our senses
  - Selective attention
  - Highlighting
  - Coding schemes
  - Graphical representations
- Our sense-making proceesses (cultural understanding) expands on what we attend to
  - This produces "experience"

Neisser's difficulty remembering sources
----------------------------------------

- "The naturalistic study of memory is an idea whose time has come"

# Sack's #

- Unintentional plagarism
  - Harrison didn't knowingly steal a melody for his song
  - We don't remember where our ideas come from
- Brainwashing
- Implanted Memories
- Historical Truth vs Narrative Truth
  - There's no easy way to distinguish between genuine memories and implanted memories
  - Sack's doesn't believe there is a way to distinguish real and constructed memories
- Experience and Memory are Constructed
- A certain type of forgetting makes cultural life possible
  - Indifference to source allows us to assimilate what we are read, told, etc into our 
    "common mind"
  - This would not be possible if our memories were tagged as exclusively ours

# Epistemic Engineers #

Kim Sterlny: Cognitive Niche Construction
-----------------------------------------

### Evolution Primer ###

- NOT "Survival of the Fittest"
  - But there is reduced representation of the less fit
- Selection on genetic variability
- Differential fitness
- Changing proportions of genetic patterns through time

- Group Selection
  - Properties and practices of groups can bestow fitness on the entire group
  - This is controversial in evolutionary biology

- Cognitive Niches are the culture that is passed down

### Cognitive Niche Construction ###

- Humans construct and inherit their own cognitive niches
- These set the selective pressures on evolution of the brain
- Brain and culture co-evolve through mutual reciprocal causation

### Culture (Non-Genetic) Inheritance

- Human groups engineer their own habitats
- This includes epistemic (cognitive) aspects

- Only humans exhibit "cumulative downstream engineering"
- The more culture you have, the more culture you create
- Positive feedback loop

- Cultural evolution happens much faster than genetic evolution

### The Pace of Cultural Change ###

- Rampant niche construction yields a rapid succession of selective epistemic environments
- It favors the biological evolution of phenotypic plascticity
  - If you're a slow learner, you will be less likely to be successful

### Developmental Plascticity is Key ###

- Evolutionary psychology expects the brain to be adapted to a "statistical composite"
  of Pleisticene environments
- Actually, we have adapted to variability by becoming more plastic

### Stone-Age Minds in a Space-Age World? ###

- The same initial set of developmental resources
- Can differentiate into quite different final cognitive products
- Changing hominid developmental environments transformed hominid brains themselves
- As hominids remade their own worlds, they indirectly remade themselves

Origins of Theory of Mind
-------------------------

### Where does our ability to imagine the mental states of others come from? ###

- Some think that we have brain parts specifically for this
- Alternative: Selection favors interpretive skills
  - Selection on parents for actions that scaffold the development of interpretive capacities
  - The offspring of parents who are inclined to engage in these actions are more likely to 
    survive
  - Getting in on this "socially constructed reality" could be advantageous to survival

- Cultural Practices induce thinking in terms of intentions and other mental states
  - People will keep bringing this model of mind into existence

### Practices Recruit Individual Abilities ###

- Through "intense social scaffolding"
- Basic perceptual abilities (gaze monitoring, etc) are recruited to form a folk psychology

Children are surrounded by examples of mind-reading in action

- Incremental environmental engineering provides a "wealth of stimulus"


Theory of Mind
--------------

- Not wired at birth
- Acquired through immersion in a rich highly-structured world

How Humans got to be Humans
---------------------------

- Much of what is human is that it is a product of cultural practices

# Assignment #

- Find between 2 and 5 cultural models

Procedure for finding cultural models

1. Examine the text word by word
2. Look for key words
  1. Logical connectives
  2. Words that name schemas
3. Highlight key words
4. Explore the relations among the clauses
5. Choose interesting examples
6. Draw a diagram of the models and their relations (optional)

Your Cascade of Representations
-------------------------------

- Interview (Raw data)
- Audio Recording of Interview
- Transcript of Audio Recording
- Analysis of transcript(Final re-representation)
