# Feb. 7 Notes #

# Part 1: Conducting an Interview #

- **Goal**: To learn how to conduct an interview

Basic Instructions
------------------

- Will need to record audio
- Find someone who is willing to talk about an activity
- Setup a time and quiet place
- Obtain informed consent

- Show the photos that you used in project 2
- Ask your informant to explain what is going on in the activity
- Must be *at least 30 minutes*, but less than one hour
  - The first 5 minutes aren't going to be very useful

### Informants, NOT Subjects ###

- Subjects are "subjected" to a procedure
- We need them to inform us

### Transcription ###

- Make sure that you put the recorder in a good spot
- Find a quiet setting
- Let the informant speak

The purpose of conducting the interview is to create a context in which the informant
can tell you what they know or believe about something

Do not judge whether what they believe is true or false, do not tell them what you think

### Deal with Observer Behavior ###

- The first few minutes will be awkward
- The informant may be nervous
- Put the informant at ease

Make it easy for the informant to keep talking

- Say "go on" when the informant is bogged down
- Repeat the last phrase as a question

Transcribing Your Interview
---------------------------

- Listen through the interview and create an **index** of what it contains
  - This is a list of topics discussed / events with time indicators
  - Choose one or two passages to transcribe
- Transcribe about 1000 words
  - "Relaxed Transcription Techniques"
  - Include false-starts and disfluencies

### Interview Index and Transcript ###

- Write up the index for the interview
- Type the transcript in clean form
- Save as one text

Most of our reality is "created". We apprehend social created objects, we jointly 
create them.
